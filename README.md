# Python Input and Output Tasks

This repository contains two simple Python scripts: `task1.py` and `task2.py`. Both scripts demonstrate basic input, output, and string formatting in Python.

## task1.py

**Features:**
- Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Handles division by zero gracefully.
- Displays the results using formatted strings.

**Usage:**
```bash
python task1.py
```
Follow the prompts to enter two numbers. The script will display the results of the calculations.

## task2.py

**Features:**
- Prompts the user to enter their first and last name.
- Concatenates the names to form a full name.
- Prints a personalized greeting using an f-string.

**Usage:**
```bash
python task2.py
```
Enter your first and last name when prompted. The script will greet you by your full name.

## Requirements

No external libraries are required.

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the scripts.
3. Run either script using:
   ```bash
   python task1.py
   ```
   or

   ```

## Notes
